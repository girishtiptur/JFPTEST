## Phase 1: Build a Robust Prediction Mechanism
**Objective:** Develop a core JFP system that proactively predicts job failure or success at the submission (start) stage using Slurm job metadata.

### 1. Seamless Integration with Submission Pipeline
- **SLURM REST API Integration:** Embed Slurm REST API (`slurmrestd`) into the job submission flow to extract live job metadata and enable real-time predictions.  
- **Pre-Submission Checkpoint:** Trigger the prediction system just before a job is submitted to Slurm, ensuring feedback is provided early to the user.

### 2. AI-Driven Reasoning for Enhanced Accuracy
- **Metadata Pattern Learning:** Use historical job metadata (e.g., CPU, memory, walltime, partition, user/job history) to train a supervised model (e.g., XGBoost, RandomForest).  
- **Failure Signature Detection:** Leverage AI to identify frequent failure combinations and detect these in incoming jobs for early intervention.

## Phase 2: Enhancement of JFP Service with LLM-Based Reasoning
**Objective:** Introduce a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve the understanding and explainability of job failure predictions.

### 1. Natural Language Understanding of Job Submissions
- Add an LLM to understand **job metadata and submission content** in natural language, including job names, comments, and script content.  
- This helps the system better analyze the job’s intent and detect potential risks.

### 2. Explainable Predictions for Users
- Once a job is predicted to fail, the LLM provides a **clear and human-readable explanation** of why the failure is likely.  
- Example: _“This job may fail because the requested memory exceeds the allowed limit for the selected partition.”_

## Phase 3: Implementation of Script Analysis Component
**Objective:** Build a job script evaluator powered by LLMs to identify and suggest corrections for errors and misconfigurations.

### 1. NLP-Based Script Review
- Use LLMs to **parse and interpret job submission scripts** (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`, `#SBATCH` directives) and detect common issues like incorrect paths, flags, or limits.  
- Highlight **missing or misused SLURM parameters** (e.g., memory not set, incorrect partition).

### 2. Intelligent Suggestions and Validation
- Suggest **optimized or corrected values** for memory, CPUs, walltime, etc., based on prior jobs or cluster policies.  
- Detect **anomalous values** that deviate from known working configurations.

---

## Phase 4: Development of Front-End GUI for Script Analysis
**Objective:** Provide a user-friendly, interactive interface for job script diagnostics and optimization.

### 1. Script Submission and Feedback UI
- Build a clean, web-based interface where users can **upload or paste job scripts** and receive **real-time analysis results**.  
- Enable side-by-side display of original script and **highlighted problem areas**.

### 2. Interactive Visualization and Suggestions
- Provide **color-coded diagnostics**, tooltips, and **auto-correct recommendations**.  
- Ensure **tight coupling with LLM backend** for seamless real-time interaction.
